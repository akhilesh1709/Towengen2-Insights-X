# Towengen2-Insights-X
We use two datasets, `messages` and `employees`. The datasets are obtained using the `pd.read_csv("file_name.csv")` method. Let's explore the initial few rows and gather information about the columns.

For this project, I used the following datasets:
1. employees.csv
2. messages.csv
